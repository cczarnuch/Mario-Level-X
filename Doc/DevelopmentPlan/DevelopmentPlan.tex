This is an ongoing document that will track our development plan for our open-source project development.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Whenever any member of the group feels the need to meet for the project, they are free to arrange a time with the group in order to discuss the project. We aim to meet or discuss our progress at least once a week. All meetings minutes are to be tracked as well, in order to minimize conflicts between group members.
\section{Team Communication Plan}
We will mostly keep in touch by communicating over Discord messenger. This is so we can easily contact each other as we all use Discord frequently.
